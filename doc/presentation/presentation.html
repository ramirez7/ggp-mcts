# Background: Game Description Language
* *role(a)* means that *a* is a role in the game.

* *base(p)* means that *p* is a base proposition in the game.

* *input(r,a)* means that *a* is an action for role *r*.

* *init(p)* means that the proposition *p* is true in the initial state.

* *true(p)* means that the proposition *p* is true in the current state.

* *does(r,a)* means that player *r* performs action *a* in the current state.

* *next(p)* means that the proposition *p* is true in the next state.

* *legal(r,a)* means it is legal for role *r* to play action *a* in the current state.

* *goal(r,n)* means that player the current state has utility *n* for player *r*.

* *terminal* means that the current state is a terminal state.

# Background: Monte-Carlo Tree Search
<img src = "mctsfigure.png" style="height:auto; width:auto; max-width:1000px; max-height:1000px;">

* *Selection* Choose amongst next-states
* *Playout* Randomly play a game to completion, noting the result
* *Expansion* The tree is typically grown one state at a time
* *Back-Propogation* Results of each state's simulation must be propogated to all of its ancestors

# Paper Critique
## Generalized Monte-Carlo Tree Search Extensions for General Game Playing
### Summary
* Multiple extensions for MCTS are proposed

* All the extensions make no game-specific assumption so that they will be applicable to general game playing.

* *Goal Stability Early Cutoff* If a simulation seems to be reasonably trending towards a conclusion, terminate early

* *Terminal Interval Early Cutoff* If a game tends to terminate in a certain interval of turns, 

* *Unexplored Action Urgency* "Exploit the fringe" by not always exploring all children

### Critique

* Took great care to make all extensions use no game-specific knowledge

* Some extensions are not applicable for many games on Stanford's website (such as Tic-Tac-Toe and even Chinese Checkers)

* No assumptions about game are made, but usefulness is determined by game description.

# Paper Critique
## Understanding the Success of Perfect Information Monte Carlo Sampling in Game Tree Search

### Summary

* Identifies three factors that affect MCTS's effectiveness in imperfect information games:

* *Leaf Correlation* How much control a player has over their fate at a certain point in the game

* *Bias* Whether or not a game inherently favors a player

* *Disambiguation Factor* In imperfect information games, how much the possibilities shrink with each revelation

### Critique

* Thorough testing of theory, with both synthetic game trees and actual games.

* Could be very applicable to GDL-II, which includes stochastic and imperfect information games

* MCTS can be exploited by an opponent

# Paper Critique
## Monte-Carlo tree search and rapid action value estimation in computer Go

### Summary

* Exhaustive mathematical explanation of Monte-Carlo Tree Search and related concepts and algorithms

* Proposes two extensions

* *Rapid Action Value Estimation (RAVE)* Speeds up MCTS vastly thanks to parallel tree nodes sharing information, but reduces effectiveness

* *MC-RAVE* Combines RAVE with more Monte-Carlo simulations in order to increase effectiveness while retaining speed

### Critique

* Only applicable to computer Go

* Results were convincingly displayed

* While not directly applicable to my implementation (GGP), the mathematical explanation still was helpful

# Background: core.logic 
##Functions vs Relations
### The plus function
```
REPL:> (+ 2 3)
5
```
### The plus relation
```
REPL:> (run* [q] (+ 2 3 q))
(5)
REPL:> (run* [q] (+ 2 q 5))
(3)
REPL:> (run* [q] (+ q 3 5))
(2)
REPL:> (run* [q] (+ 2 3 5))
(._0) ;; SUCCESS
REPL:> (run* [q] (+ 2 3 7))
() ;; FAILURE
```
* The (run* [q] RELATION) macro means “give me all the values of q such that the relation (with q substituted in accordingly) succeeds”

# Motivation: English->GDL->core.logic
### English

It is Legal for player **w** to mark cell (**m**,**n**) if it is true that cell (**m**,**n**) is blank and it is true that it is player **w**'s turn to move. If it is X's turn to move, O can only noop. If it is O's turn to move, X can only noop. That is, they take turns.

    (true (cell ?m ?n b))

### core.logic

    (== role ?w)
    (== action [:mark ?m ?n])
    (true [:cell ?m ?n :b])

  [(== role :X)
   (== action :noop)
   (true [:control :O])]
  [(== role :O)
   (== action :noop)
   (true [:control :X])]))
```
---
# Motivation: Use of core.logic legal relation
### Legality checking
```
REPL:> (run* [q] (legal :X [:mark 1 1]))
(._0) ;; SUCCESS
REPL:> (run* [q] (legal :O [:mark 1 1]))
() ;; FAILURE. O cannot mark any square
```
### Legal move generation
```
REPL:> (run* [q] (legal :X q))
([:mark 3 3] [:mark 3 2] [:mark 3 1]
 [:mark 2 3] [:mark 2 2] [:mark 2 1]
 [:mark 1 3] [:mark 1 2] [:mark 1 1])
REPL:> (run* [q] (legal :O q))
(:noop)
```

# Implementation: GDL->core.logic
## The Environment
* Runs through arbitrary GDL description and generates an *environment* that represents game rules and state
* Each relation now takes an extra argument of the environment so that it can call other relations in the GDL translation:

```Clojure
;; :legal
(fn [env role action]
 (conde
  [(fresh [?w ?m ?n]
    (== role ?w)
    (== action [:mark ?m ?n])
    ((get-relation env :true) [:cell ?m ?n :b])
    ((get-relation env :true) [:control ?w]))]
  [(== role :X)
   (== action :noop)
   ((get-relation env :true) [:control :O])]
  [(== role :O)
   (== action :noop)
   ((get-relation env :true) [:control :X])]))

(defn get-relation [env r]
  (partial (env r) env))
```
---
# Implementation: GDL->core.logic
## Pre-processing
```Clojure
(collect-relations gdl ;;-->

{:legal
  {:args [env G__6139 G__6140]
   :body (quote ((<= (legal ?w (mark ?m ?n))
    	             (true (cell ?m ?n b))
    	             (true (control ?w)))
  	           (<= (legal X noop)
 	      	      (true (control O)))
		         (<= (legal O noop)
       		      (true (control X)))))}
 ;; etc
}

```
---
# Implementation: GDL->core.logic
## Translation rules
### Reflexive head calls turn into unifications of args

```Clojure
;; Transforming Legal
(legal ?w (mark ?x ?y))
;; -~->
(== role ?w)
(== move [:mark ?x ?y])
```
### All other relations reference the environment

```Clojure
(true (cell 1 1 b))
;; -~->
((get-relation env :true) [:cell 1 1 :b])
```

### not turns into negation as failure constraint (nafc)
```Clojure
(not (line X))
;; -~->
(nafc (env :line) env :X)
```
---
# Implementation: GDL->core.logic
## Translation rules
### Relation are joined in a fresh block
```Clojure
(<= (head & args)
    & tail)
;; -~->
(fresh [fresh-vars]
 (transformed head)
 (transformed tail))
```
### Multiple related relations are joined by a disjunction (conde)
```Clojure
(relation1)
(relation2)
;; ...
(relationN)
;; -~->
(conde
 [(transformed relation1)]
 [(transformed relation2)]
 ;; ...
 [(transformed relationN)])
```
---
# Implementation: MCTS
## Algorithm skeleton
```Clojure
(defn mcts-iteration
  "Performs one iteration of MCTS on state env, using initial
  statistics stats, playing as player"
  [env stats player]
  (loop [env env, stats stats, path (list env)]
    (if (terminal? env)
      (mcts-backprop path (get-scores env) stats)
      (if (not-empty (mcts-unexplored env stats))
        (mcts-grow stats path)
        (let [ch (mcts-select env stats player)]
          (recur ch stats (cons ch path)))))))
```

# Implementation: Goal-Stability Early Cutoff
## Pseudo-code from the article
<img src = "goalpseudo.png" style="height:auto; width:auto; max-width:1000px; max-height:1000px;">
## Snippet of Clojure code
```Clojure
(if (or (terminal? env)
        (and use-early-cutoff?
             (is-goal-stable? goals threshold)
             (>= steps cut)))
     scores
     (recur (rand-nth (gen-children env)) next-goals (inc steps)))
```
