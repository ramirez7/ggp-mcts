# General Game Playing Monte-Carlo Tree Search

This was my semester project for Purdue ECE 570: Artificial Intelligence. I implemented a General Game Playing, Monte-Carlo Tree Search algorithm with some enhancements from the current papers I read.

In the process, I created some easy-to-use code that can translate Game Description Language descriptions of game rules to usable Clojure functions.

## Usage

create-environment is the core of the GDL->core.logic. Just call it on a GDL description represented as a quoted list of GDL declarations and it will create an environment representing the game logic and state. This environment can then be passed to best-move and the AI will play.

To access a produced core.logic relation, call (get-relation env :RELATION-NAME). The resulting relation will take the same arguments in the same order as the GDL relation.

If you want to see the Clojure core.logic code generated, call create-code on the GDL description. A map of quoted code will be produced, with the keys being the GDL relation names as keywords.

## Progress

* Tic-Tac-Toe GDL successfuly translated to core.logic
* GDL->core.logic translator complete
* MCTS algorithm complete and should work with any GDL game
* Goal Stability Early Cutoff MCTS extension implemented
