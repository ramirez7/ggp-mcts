;; NOTES
;; Every relation now takes a new arg: env, which is a map
;; that represents the current environment. This allows for doeso
;; and trueo to be rebound at runtime, which is essential for building
;; any search tree.
;; 
;; I transformed ttt_relations.clj to this file with some simple commands:
;; (Ignore "'s in the commends. Those are there for clarity
;; - M-x replace-regex [RET] "(defn [A-Za-z]+ \[" [RET] "\&env " [RET]
;; - Then, for each relation previous defined:
;;   - M-x-% "(<NAME>" [RET] "((get-binding env :<NAME>)" [RET]
;; - Finally, you make a map associating the appropriate keyword with
;;   each relation



;; Returns the relation bound to symbol name in environment env
;; Uses partial application to return a relation that doesn't need
;; an environment argument
